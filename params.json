{"name":"Zen Templates","tagline":"Web template language for generating clean, standards-compliant web sites.","body":"# Zen Templates\r\n## Simple, elegant HTML5 templates.\r\n============\r\n\r\nZen Templates is a web template language for generating clean, standards-compliant web sites from templates that will render on their own in a standard web browser. All template files are themselves fully valid HTML5 that can be previewed by a designer without needing to run the full application.\r\n\r\nThe key goals of Zen Templates are:\r\n* Seamless HTML 5 integration - templates and output should be fully compliant, renderable HTML 5 markup.\r\n* Semantic parsing - semantic information offered in classes and IDs should be usable in place of custom tags or attributes.\r\n* Intuitive rendering - if an element is backed by a collection in the model, repeat the element for each item in the collection.\r\n* Platform-agnostic - the same templates should be renderable by applications running on Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, node.js, and so on.\r\n\r\nPlatform implementations in progress:\r\n* Java (original prototype - official implementation pending)\r\n* C#: http://github.com/aprice/ZenTemplatesDotNet/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
